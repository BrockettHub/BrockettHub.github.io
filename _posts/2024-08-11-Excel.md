For my first project i was exploring livesql.oracle.com and the various data tables that they had to explore.  

It is a smaller data set but i was curious to see if rating of a product could be corrolated to a higher return rate.

Check out the excel version [Project][Projects]

## Findings
I was expeting to find that when the ratings were lower that the completion rate would also be lower.  However with the ratings falling within 3% from min to max I can not make that conclution.  Also it was interesting to see that a mediocare rating had the highest sales.

I did look at the percentage of reviews vs transactions and it averaged 7% chance of a transaction having a review.  I find this value satisfactory based on other such surveys.
## Follow up
- Verify how surveys are captured, there was 1 outlier where there was a survey but no sale.
- Follow up with leadership to see if they are currently spending any money to help drive survey rates.  
- Verify survey capture methods are robust and understanding how surveys are being promoted could provide deeper insights.

## Final
If we are spending any money on increasing ratings i would suggest it be allocated to driving survey take rate.  This should decrease return rate on those categories that dont have any reviews and potentially increase sales.
